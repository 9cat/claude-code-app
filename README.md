## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Flutter 3.x development environment
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Remote server with SSH access
- Claude API access

### 1. **Clone and Setup**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/9cat/claude-code-app.git
cd claude-code-app
```

### 2. **Deploy Remote Environment**
```bash
# Copy your Anthropic API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Deploy Claude-Code container
docker-compose up -d

# Verify deployment
docker exec -it claude-code bash
```

### 3. **Configure Mobile App**
1. Launch the app
2. Enter your SSH connection details (IP, port, username, key/password)
3. App automatically deploys and connects to Claude-Code container
4. Start coding through the chat interface!

## üì± App Workflow

### **First Launch Setup**
